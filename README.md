# cs4249 Assignment 1

* Added `index.html` which contains the Pre-Experiment Questionnaire and some info about the experiment.
* Added `instructions.html`, which appears after `index.html`, which has the instructions for the participant.
* When clicking "Next" after the instructions, the participant will be prompted to enter a participant id, which is a number.
* After enterting a number, the participant will reach `experiment.html`. Unfortunately, I did not finish implementing arranging the trials and conditions. (Turns out it's really time consuming to populate a menu with breadth 8 and depth 3.)
* Add a click counter to `experiment-tracker.js`.
* Added an `img` folder which contains screenshots used by the instructions page.
